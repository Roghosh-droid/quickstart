Patients in the experimental group were treated with AR-based rehabilitation methods, while those in the control group were treated with traditional rehabilitation methods. Afterwards, the two groups of patients were compared with various indicators such as pain value, swelling, structural and functional recovery, time to complete weight bearing, time to return to work, and X-ray examination results. The main evaluation tools used were Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score. The results showed that after six weeks, the HSS score of the control group was , and the HSS score of the experimental group was .
