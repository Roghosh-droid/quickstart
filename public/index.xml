There are new hardware, software, products, and solutions that are being released constantly into the market to ensure that the systems can be kept current and updated with regard to efficiency and security functionality and capabilities. But when a product has completed its useful life and support and updates are withdrawn, cybercriminals get huge opportunities to exploit security vulnerabilities and breach outdated security firewalls.</description>
